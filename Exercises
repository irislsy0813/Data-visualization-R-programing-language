## A Data Munging

rm(list=ls())

library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(rpart)
library(rpart.plot)

data<-read.csv("data29521262.csv")
head(data)

##1. What is the average GDP per capita for countries in the test set?

TSdata<-filter(data, TrainTest=="Test")
mean(TSdata$PerCapitaGDP)

##2. What is the average GDP per capita for countries in the training set?

TRdata<-filter(data, TrainTest=="Train")
mean(TRdata$PerCapitaGDP)

## 3. How does your answer to Q1 change if we only consider countries for which the services industry is the largest industry?

TSdata2<-filter(data, (LargestIndustry=="Services")&(TrainTest=="Test"))
mean(TSdata2$PerCapitaGDP)

##B Basic Visualisation

##1. Plot a scatterplot of GDP per capita (y axis) against Debt to GDP ratio (x axis).

ggplot(data,map=aes(x=DebtGDP, y=PerCapitaGDP))+
  geom_point(position = "jitter")+
  geom_smooth(color = "skyblue", fill = "skyblue", method = "lm")

##2. Describe the relationship between GDP per capita and Debt to GDP ratio. Is there enough evidence to conclude that any relationship is a causal relationship?

Negative relationship but no causal relationship.Because visualizations like a scatterplot only give association not causal. 

##3. Plot the same plot as Question 1 only this time facet by credit rating. Allow each fact to have its own values on the y axis.

ggplot(data,map=aes(x=DebtGDP, y=PerCapitaGDP))+
  geom_point(position = "jitter")+
  facet_wrap(~CreditRating, nrow=5, ncol=2, scale="free_y")

##C Classification tree

##1. Fit a classification tree to all the data with Largest Industry as the target variable debt to GDP as the predictor. Generate a plot of the tree.

rpart_small<-rpart(LargestIndustry~DebtGDP,data = TRdata)
rpart.plot(rpart_small)

##2. What Industry would the tree predict for a country with a Debt to GDP ratio of 90.31 percentage points?

Aguriculture

##3. Explain how a classification tree is constructed

The algorithm considers all possible splits for all possible variables. The variable and split is chosen based on what best
seperates the categories of the target variable by some criterion (e.g., Gini coefficient). A number of criteria can be used to
decide when to stop building tree. Some of these things include setting a minimum number of observations in each bin, stopping when
the Gini coefficient Cã€‡r the criterion) is no longer improved by more than a threshold or when a maximum tree depth is achieved. |
